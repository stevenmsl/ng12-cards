- Set Up Input Bidning
  - in the parent component template, find where we create
    the child component #TA01
  - decide on the property name that we want to use to 
    communicate from the parent to the child #TA01
  - add a new binding to the child component, specifying
    the data we want to pass down #TA01
  - In the child component's class file, add an input
    property. This tells the component to expect the
    parent to provide the value for this property #TA02
  - In the child component's template file, reference
    that input property #TA03

- Use Host Element Selectors
  - this is used to style the app.component without
    using global CSS. #TA04
